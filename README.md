## Remote Database Connection \(connect to web based database\)


</div>

### Description

The demo will show you how to use ADO to connect to a database hosted on a web server. From there all standard uses of ADO recordsets and what not are possible. I see this question asked a lot in newsgroups so I thought I would share this code here to to help refer them to a working example. Note, the web server has to be a server you have rights to and not just some free web hoster like GeoCities so don't get too excited if you thought that is what this was. This demo will connect to my web server and read data from the NorthWind database found in SQL Server. Also note, my web server cannot handle a lot of traffic so depending on how many people download this and try it, you may have some slow responses or errors on connection. Sorry, but this is just a demo. This code is really not advanced, but many people do not know you can use ADO like this so I just wanted a demo up to point people to later on. Hope it helps some.
